Treva W: Thank you for reaching out to Rackspace Cloud Support!  How may I help you?
You: Hi, I am facing a network issue on one of my servers
You: sometimes it goes off netowrk
You: ?
Treva W: Okay. Which server?
You: 23.253.81.220 ( talaco-slave)
Treva W: Okay. Are you having networking issues right now? I can watch traffic from the host to see where it's being dropped
You: yes
You: still 
Treva W: Okay, let me take a look
Treva W: This is over publicnet, correct?
You: yes 
You: sure
Treva W: Alright, give me a few minutes to investigate.
You: ok
Treva W: Are you downloading anything currently?
You: no 
You: is there a traffic to it ?
Treva W: There's a lot of traffic going out, yes but I don't see anything coming in. Most of the traffic is going to the 124.226.66.0/16 subnet, which is apparently belonging to China Telecom
You: mm how can i stop this ?
You: can u break it out 
Treva W: You might be running a botnet. Here's a sample of traffic I'm seeing - https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e98434e5ebae1c8b0bee
Treva W: Here's a series of articles that will help you investigate. Hopefully this can be cleaned up by changing server passwords but you may need to put the server into rescue mode - http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/recovering-from-and-dealing-with-a-site-compromise
You: ok thanks, !
